## Season 1 - USB on Teensy2
- [x] via raw avrdude/stuff
    - [x] create project with `cargo-generate`, for one of supported boards with atmega32u4
        - [x] Leonardo was chosen
    - [x] build the Leonardo project to get a hex file for Leonardo
    - [x] switch to a non-`arduino_hal` type of project, based on `examples/atmega2560`, but keep using `atmega32u4` instead
    - [x] on Teensy, how pin 11 (A10) of the Teensy board maps to atmega32u4 microcontroller's registers/memory/thigs (pin?)
        - seemingly it should be: **PD6**
    - [x] blinky! on raw `atmega32u4`
    - [x] how to acces `PD6` atmega32u4 pin in Rust?
    - [x] try <https://github.com/mogenson/atmega32u4-usb-serial> - Teensy USB C bindings
        - didn't work with `hid_listen.exe` :/
            - could be many things - either misconfig, or other bug, or just Vendor ID or smth not recognized by `hid_listen.exe`.

### WIP
- [x] via raw avrdude/stuff
    - `C:\Users\Mateusz\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages\teensy\tools\teensy-compile\11.3.1\avr\bin\avr-gcc`
    - <https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal>
    - [x] serial output & serial monitor
        - [x] a) embed Teensy C code via FFI
            - [x] ðŸŽ‰ try `usb_debug_only.c` from Teensy C "blinky" example
    - [x] detect a pressed switch from a pullup pin
        - [x] set pin as pullup
            - `PB0` 
        - [x] read it in loop
        - [x] if pressed, quickly toggle LED with much shorter delay
    - [x] when key pressed, send character to serial output
        - [x] wrap unsafe usb write code in a helper func
        - [x] do not send again until key released
            - [x] keep state
    - [x] do the same but over USB HID, simulating a keyboard
        - [x] use C++ code from Teensyduino
        - [x] USB key send on switch press
            - <https://forum.pjrc.com/index.php?threads/keyboard-press-doesnt-like-it-when-i-feed-it-a-string.71874/#post-318669>
            - <https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_keyboard.html> 
        - [x] another USB key send on switch release
        - `C:/Users/Mateusz/AppData/Local/Arduino15/packages/teensy/hardware/avr/1.59.0/cores/usb_serial_hid/usb.c` 
        - `C:/Users/Mateusz/AppData/Local/Arduino15/packages/teensy/hardware/avr/1.59.0/cores/teensy/pins_teensy.c`
            - [ ] maybe `rust-bindgen`?
                - <https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/cpp.html#constructor-semantics> ?
                - [ ] concerns: <https://cxx.rs/context.html#c-vs-c>
            - [ ] âœ– ~~maybe <https://docs.rs/autocxx> ?~~
                - probably not possible b/c autocxx is (?) wrapper over cxx
            - [x] âœ– ~~maybe <https://cxx.rs> ?~~
                - seems impossible due to its apparent dependency on `std` (through `foldhash`) 
    - [ ] LATER: run `cargo doc --features <your-mcu> --open` in <https://rahix.github.io/avr-hal/atmega_hal/index.html> crate's dir
