# Milestones

## S1 - USB on Teensy2
To check we can run Rust in Teensy.
- <file:///C:/prog/avr-hal/target/doc/atmega_hal/index.html>
- `C:\Users\Mateusz\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages\teensy`
- <https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal>
- <https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_keyboard.html> 

## ðŸš€ Chorditeâ€¦
Actual keyboard stuff.
- USB HID
- Keyboard (use `#include <Keyboard.h>`?)

### Thoughts
- IN: current state of 8 switches, as a byte (`u8`)
- OUT: either `(key, modifiers)`, or `nothing`
- STATE: "most" switches (`u8`)
- CONFIG:
    - Layout "look-up table": map `u8` -> either `(key, modifiers)` OR...
        - 256 entries ??
        - ~68 entires in the "old" chordite firmware cheatsheet I tried
            - [ ] <https://docs.rs/heapless/latest/heapless/struct.LinearMap.html> ?
- LATER:
    - SoA for `no_std` ?
        - port `soa_rs`?

    - [ ] ðŸ”” ðŸš€ integrate with `chordite_rust` to try on real hardware!
        - [ ] try generic-izing stuff:
            - [x] `lookup()`
                - [x] Trait?
                - [ ] FnMut?

            - [x] try using Chordite::handle() and passing the result to the new usb function
            - [x] debounce
                - <https://crates.io/crates/debouncr> ? 
            - [x] fixup the `path = ...` dependency in `Cargo.toml`
    - [x] right_alt (`ALTGR_MASK`) - for Polish letters
    - [x] bug:
        - [x] `SHIFT, R-ALT, E` -> gives capital `E`, should give capital `Ä˜`
    - [x] missing
        - [x] `%`
        - [x] `#`
        - [x] CapsLock

    - [x] layout redesign?
    - [ ] real Alt-Tab
    - [ ] Tests
    - [x] layout config outsourced to the importer of Chordite type
        - [x] prob'ly through a Trait
- [ ] LATER: main LED
- [ ] LATER: more LEDs
- [ ] LATER: simplify the USB code - leave only what I need
    - [ ] ideally, esp. drop the need for setting `F_CPU`
    - [ ] allow providing keycodes from Rust rather than from C
    - [ ] LATER: try to make it fit in the API expected by `avr_hal`
    - [ ] <https://github.com/xoac/static-bytes> ?
- [ ] LATER LATER: easily configurable dynamically
    - [ ] <https://crates.io/crates/miniconf> ?
    - [ ] <https://crates.io/crates/unicode-width> ?

## Mouse
- [ ] connection diagram for GY-521 <-> Teensy2
    - [ ] some Arduino thing?
- [x] see if I can find an existing Arduino sketch for GY-521 (MPU6050)
- [x] try see some changing values
    - yay Serial Plotter <3
- [ ] "draw a cursor position on a rectangular pseudo-screen"
- [ ] branch 1:
    - [ ] smoothing of noise
    - [ ] projection on flat surface (?)
    - [ ] LATER: multipliers for speed
    - [ ] LATER LATER: "dynamic precision" algorithm
- [ ] "on/off" switch
    - [ ] start with just a jumper wire on the breadboard
- [x] USB mouse
- [ ] ðŸ”” ðŸš€ USB mouse in Rust
    - [ ] ðŸ”” ðŸš€ try importing mpu6050-dmp-rs lib
    - [ ] try initializing i2c on Teensy2
    - [ ] try attaching mpu6050 object to i2c
    - [ ] try reading some results and dumping them to serial (use arduino serial plotter format)
- [ ] LATER: try use DMP <https://github.com/barafael/mpu6050-dmp-rs/tree/master/examples>
- [x] LATER: see if I can find ready-made GY-521 (or MPU6050) mouse sketch (Arduino/Teensy)
- [ ] looksy: <https://github.com/NeoBirth/accelerometer.rs>
- [ ] looksy: <https://crates.io/crates/dcmimu>

## Improvements
- [ ] mouse: still too shaky; try improving this
    - [ ] try enabling builtin DMP
        - [ ] first, only for stability etc.
        - [ ] LATER: also try and see what calibration can give
        - [ ] try doing my own extra averaging / low-pass filter
        - [ ] maybe google up some "stabilization" algorithms or something, maybe for mouse/pointer
- [ ] kbd: improve debounce
    - [ ] esp. on: Space, `t`
- [x] kbd/mouse: chords to simulate mouse scroll up/down
    - ~~try to take from easy keys maybe~~
- [ ] try making time-based things work on counted timers instead of just changing delay when I want faster/slower - there's more than one thing now so it no longer works well
    - [ ] maybe use <https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-executor/git/cortex-m/index.html> ?
    - [ ] mouse
    - [ ] kbd / debounce
- [ ] "layout configurator Lua script"
- [ ] kbd: fix "sticky Alt"
- [ ] kbd: try to find some still-unused better combinations for some keys that show up more needed
    - [ ] Alt
    - [ ] "Shift layer"? make it some new better layer?
    - [x] GUI?
    - [ ] `:`?
    - [x] ~~I never yet used Del - maybe move it to "Shift-layer", and make `^^__` enable the layer?~~
    - [ ] mouse buttons
- [ ] mouse: model a sphere and properly move cursor when tilted
- [ ] LATER: maybe new mouse layer enabling some "instant reaction" buttons (non-chorded)  

## Wireless
- BLE?
- Battery-powered?
    - 2xAAA accumulator ? (or even 1xAAA ?)
        - "DC-to-DC boost converter" ?
     
## Asides & Experiments
- <https://docs.rs/ufmt>
- [ ] cleanup the `build.rs` script
- [ ] cleanup: move C & CPP code to some separate directory in the project tree
- [x] slap AGPL headers on source files
- [ ] fix README
- [ ] Arduino "serial monitor protocol" wrapper for use with Teensy serial monitor handler
    - [ ] intercept and capture `teensy-monitor.exe` inputs issued by Arduino IDE
        - should in theory match: <https://github.com/arduino/pluggable-monitor-protocol-handler/blob/main/monitor.go>
    - [ ] implement a wrapper for easy viewing of serial output of Teensy
- [ ] for KeyWithFlags, impl/derive Debug trait, for nice debugging to serial port
- [ ] make KeyWithFlags be an enum
- [x] can I merge chordite-rust + chordite-chords into single cargo workspace?
- [ ] try going to newer rust
    - [ ] edition2024
    - [ ] new nightly at or after edition2024
